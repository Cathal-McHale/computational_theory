## Task 1
- 32 bits unsigned -(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-representation-of-a-given-number/)
# Binary Operations in Python

This project demonstrates fundamental binary operations in Python, including bitwise rotations, bit selection, and majority voting. These operations are commonly used in cryptographic applications and low-level computing tasks.

## Features Implemented

# Bitwise Left Rotation (rotl)

- Rotates the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer to the left by n places.

- Ensures bit shifts stay within 32-bit limits.

- **Reference**: Circular Shift (Wikipedia)

- Bitwise Right Rotation (rotr)

- Rotates the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer to the right by n places.

- **Reference**: Circular Shift (Wikipedia)

- Binary Representation (bin_representation)

- Returns a 32-bit binary representation of a number as a string.

- **Reference**: Bitwise Operators in Python

# Choose Function (ch)

- Implements the bitwise Choose (CH) operation.

- Selects bits from y where x has bits set to 1 and bits from z where x has bits set to 0.

- Formula: ch(x, y, z) = (x & y) ^ (~x & z)

- **Reference**: SHA-2 (Wikipedia)

# Majority Function (maj)

- Takes a majority vote of bits in x, y, and z.

- Outputs a 1 where at least two of x, y, z have 1â€™s in position i.

- Formula: maj(x, y, z) = (x & y) ^ (x & z) ^ (y & z)

- **Reference**: Majority Function (Wikipedia)


# Task 2: Hash Functions

This section covers hash functions, specifically implementing and testing a hash function inspired by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's C code. We will convert the given C function to Python, test it with different inputs, and analyse the choice of values 31 and 101.

### **Features Implemented**

#### **Hash Function (hash_function)**
- Converts a given string into an integer hash value.
- Uses a rolling hash approach, where each character contributes to the final hash value.
- Ensures values fit within 101 buckets using modular arithmetic.
- **Reference**: [Hash Functions in C and Python](https://realpython.com/python-hash-functions/)

#### **Mathematical Formula**
The hash function is implemented using the formula:
```
hashval = ord(char) + 31 * hashval
hashval = hashval % 101  # Ensuring distribution within 101 buckets
```
- **31 is a prime number**, reducing the risk of hash collisions.
- **101 is also a prime number**, ensuring better distribution when applying the modulus operation.
- The combination of multiplication and modulus makes it efficient for rolling hash algorithms like **Rabin-Karp**.
